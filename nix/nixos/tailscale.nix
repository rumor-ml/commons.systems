# Tailscale VPN Module
#
# Tailscale provides secure, zero-config VPN networking between your machines.
# Perfect for WSL2 where IP addresses change frequently.
#
# Benefits:
# - Stable IP addresses that don't change (even when WSL2 restarts)
# - Secure encrypted connections between your devices
# - Works from anywhere (not just LAN)
# - No router configuration or port forwarding needed
# - Simple hostname-based access (machine-name.tail-scale-network.ts.net)
#
# After enabling this module:
#   1. Rebuild: sudo nixos-rebuild switch
#   2. Authenticate: sudo tailscale up
#   3. Get your IP: tailscale ip -4
#   4. SSH using Tailscale: ssh user@machine-name.your-tailnet.ts.net
#
