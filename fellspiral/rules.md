# New Player Concepts

**Initiative** is essential for controlling the tempo of battle. The player with initiative has narrative control of how an exchange plays out. This is especially important for determining the nature of the damage dealt. The player with initiative describes the exchange, then the referee assesses damage and other effects. 

**The referee and antagonist roles** are distinct. Both may be assigned to a GM, or they may be given to different players. The player with initiative cannot narrate arbitrarily. The referee is responsible for determining if the narration falls within these bounds:
- Narration cannot contradict the written rules. A player cannot decapitate a stone golem with their walking stick, because that's not how the rules for walking sticks work.
- Narration must match the setting. A zombie that picks up his severed arm and continues an attack may work for some settings, but not others. 
- Players cannot change the basic nature of characters they aren't playing. You cannot narrate that Varinax the Ancient White Dragon is afraid of spiders, because that is not part of her character. 

The antagonist is encouraged to be as competitive and ruthless as the character would be. This is possible because the narrative boundaries for the antagonist are essentially the same as for the other players.

**Damage Dealt** is dealt in the form of "slots" and/or "conditions". Slots are player capabilities that can be lost during combat. A player's dexterity, luck or equipment may allow them to avoid a strike without consequence. This is represented by AC. When this fails, equipment or skill slots are lost, or conditions are inflicted. 
- A player can have up to 10 equipment slots and 10 skill slots.
- Equipment must be "equipped" to be used in combat. A player may carry extra equipment in available slots, but can only equip what makes sense for the setting (cannot wear two helmets, etc.)
- Player AC starts at 6 and increases with each piece of armor equipped. AC cannot drop below 2.
- When a player fails to defend with AC, but no longer has the necessary equipment or skills to absorb the strike they take the "shot to the heart" condition. 

**Combat Rounds** are divided into 5 phases. 
- At the end of the round any player with the "shot to the heart" condition is removed from the game. 
- At the beginning of combat each player chooses a phase to act. Each competing side rolls a d20. The lowest roll chooses the starting phase and acts first in that phase. 
- If two sides share a phase, the side that last had initiative acts first.

# Combat Rules

**Zones**: the battlefield is divided into zones by the referee representing about 10 paces depending on terrain. Within a zone, something can be adjacent or non-adjacent. By default, you cannot pass through foes.

**Actions**: Moving within a zone, speaking and using consumables can be done at the beginning of player's phase without an action. Then, they may choose 1 of the following actions:
- Move to next zone.
- Attack: Defender rolls a d20 defense die. The attack is a strike if defense die + weapon die > AC.
    - Unarmed combatants attack with a d4 and strike for 1 slot of damage by default.
    - By default, defender must be adjacent. 
    - You may roll 1 attack skill at the same time as your attack as one action.
    - You may roll 1 defense skill at the same time as your defense roll.
    - +2 weapon roll if high ground.
    - -2 weapon roll if low ground, or foe is obscured by the environment.
- Equip gear from slots or the adjacent environment.
- Use an action skill, interact with the environment or cast a spell.
- "Hold": Skip your action and choose a different phase. Act in that phase until you hold again.
- "Hurry": move and perform another action - or, move again - at the cost of -5 AC for one round.

**Trading Initiative:** 
- By default, the defender has initiative.
- On strike and max roll of any weapon die ("crit"), or when granted by other skills/equipment, the attacker takes initiative.
- For each attack action, the player with initiative may narrate the loss of 1 slot, OR replace 1 slot of damage with 1 condition for 1 round. Defender(s) decide the remaining slots.
- If defender rolls a 20, the first equipment slot lost (if any) is destroyed permanently.

> Remember, all narration will be adjudicated by the ref for rules, setting and character consistency. The ref will have more or less arbitration power depending on attacker's knowledge of foe's capabilities, knowledge of the game world, knowledge of the rules, and the creativity of role play.

# Combat Reference

**Conditions** of the same type do not stack. Condition is replaced if re-afflicted:
- Pinned: Attacker has initiative against pinned foe and +2 to weapon rolls, but pinned condition is lost if any weapon or defense roll is 1.
- Stunned: Cannot take action during phase.
- Exhausted/Freezing: Cannot hurry, use skills, or spells. +5 defender AC when attacking. Removed from game after 1 full day.
- Afraid: Must use action to move away from foe.
- Immobilized: Cannot use move action, or move within zone.
- Bleeding/Corrosion/Burning: Strike 1 slot at start of defender phase - bleeding: defender chooses skill, corrosion: defender chooses equipment, burning: random.

**Legend:** The combat rules are brief, but adding weapons and skills make combat much more tactical. This shorthand is used for describing equipment and skills. These do not need to be learned all at once. Instead, refer to this when you are learning how to use new equipment or skills.
- <chip>0-2 ranged</chip>: Can attack non-adjacent defender at range of 0-2 zones. If adjacent foe, weapon cannot be used.
- <chip>0-1 thrown</chip>: Can attack non-adjacent defender at range of 0-1 zones. Drop weapon when used on non-adjacent defender. If adjacent foe, weapon can only be used on adjacent defender.
- <chip>-1z2-3</chip>: -1 Weapon roll at range 2-3.
- <chip>reach</chip>: Can attack non-adjacent enemy in the same zone.
- <chip>1x</chip>: On crit strike, deal 1 additional slot of damage.
- <chip>2h</chip>: Requires the use of both hands.
- <chip>swept</chip>: Requires open space to use effectively.
- <chip>d4r</chip>: Reload d4 phases. -5 AC and cannot use this weapon. Can only reload 1 weapon at a time.
- <chip>-1c</chip>: -1 minimum roll to crit (min 2).
- <chip>1 adjacent</chip>: On strike, also choose 1 character adjacent to defender to strike (friend or foe, if any).
- <chip>brutish</chip>: Attacker does not gain initiative on crit.
- <chip>bulky</chip>: Occupies an additional inventory slot.
- <chip>durable x2</chip>: Can absorb 2 additional slots of damage.

# Initiative Example

Use this example to think about how to use initiative to your advantage.

You are fresh from camp when ambushed by a hungry goblin. The goblin attacks with his rusty sword and strikes for 1 slot, but as defender you retain the initiative.

> "My father's ceremonial sword will have its day of vengeance, but today is not that day. It is safely tucked within my bedroll. I step back from the goblin attack just in time, but the ceremonial sword is inaccessible now that the pace of battle has quickened."

You have lost access to your ceremonial sword, but it is not of tactical importance. Now, it is your turn. You attack with your dagger. It is more difficult to land a blow with the dagger, but when you do it strikes true. The goblin is lightly armored, and you score a critical strike to gain the initiative. With initiative, you may choose to inflict a condition in place of one slot of damage.

> "The goblin knows he is outmatched, but he is hungry and desperate. I slice with my dagger. It is only enough to graze his cheek, but it's enough to frighten the goblin and make him flee".

A dagger might not invoke fear in every combat situation, but given the creative role play the referee rules that in this case it is consistent with the narrative. The goblin is forced to flee on his turn. Now you have him - you use your turn to pull out your long bow. You hurry to create more distance. The goblin steels himself, only to turn and meet your first arrow.

> Antagonist: "The arrow strikes flesh, but this only enrages the goblin as he charges back at the adventurer (the goblin uses his flesh wound skill)."

The goblin hurries to close the gap. You hurry to maintain distance - another arrow finds goblin meat, but he charges on enraged. Now adjacent, your defenses are lowered by your haste. With a critical melee he takes the initiative.

> Antagonist: "The goblin leaps onto the adventurer, grasping his lapel, pinning him."

Your long bow is useless against the adjacent foe. You retrieve your dagger, but the goblin has initiative as he clings to your chest and thrashes - you are pinned.

> Antagonist: "The adventurer stumbles backward under the rabid goblin. He trips and drops his dagger."

Fortunately, you always carry a backup. Your AC defends you against his next strike.

> The goblin tried to bite me but the teeth fail to sink through my bracers.

Now, dagger in hand, goblin at your throat, you once again strike true. How do you finish him?
