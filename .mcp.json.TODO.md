## TODO(#1739): No integration tests for MCP server direnv wrapper

**Location:** .mcp.json lines 5-11 (gh-workflow), 15-21 (gh-issue), 25-31 (wiggum)

The bash wrapper with direnv export should have integration tests to verify:

- Direnv export executes successfully
- Correct Node.js binary is used (Nix vs Homebrew)
- MCP servers can start and respond to requests
- Error handling when direnv fails

**Tracking Issue:** https://github.com/n8n1/commons.systems/issues/1739
