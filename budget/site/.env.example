# Firebase Emulator Configuration (QA Environment)

# Notes:
# - For production usage: Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual Firebase values
# - For QA testing: Run `make dev-qa` which auto-generates .env with emulator config
# - Never commit .env file to version control
# - These variables are exposed to the client-side code (safe for public)
# - The VITE_ prefix is required for Vite to include them in the build
