      # Cross-compile test: Build Darwin Home Manager configuration on Linux CI
      # Validates that the complete aarch64-darwin configuration evaluates and builds successfully
      # Catches Nix evaluation errors, missing packages, and module configuration issues
      #
      # What this validates:
      # - Home Manager configuration evaluates without errors
      # - All Home Manager modules (including WezTerm) have valid Nix syntax
      # - All packages in the configuration are available for aarch64-darwin
      # - Cross-compilation to aarch64-darwin works on Linux runners
      #
      # Note: Uses --no-link so build artifacts are not retained (evaluation check only)
      #
      # Manual test: Introduce syntax error in nix/home/wezterm.nix and verify CI fails
